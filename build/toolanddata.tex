\section{Tool and Data Availability}
hddRASS tool is available at \url{https://github.com/amchristi/hddRASS}. It can be utilized to execute the baseline TBSM technique or to use the TBSM technique with heuristics guidance (H1, H2, CBLS, or AdFL). It also provides support to execute TBSM in greedy mode. As TSAS is a proprietary system, we cannot make its source code, test suite, or tests labels available. NetBeans IDE (and hence \texttt{openide.awt} module) source code is available online. We  provide the exact \texttt{openide.awt} module source code, test suite and test labels that we utilized available at: \url{https://github.com/amchristi/AdFL}. The same link contains 800 synthetic adaptation scenarios with source code, tests, and test labels for empirical evaluation and comparison.
