\section{Tool and Data Availability}
The hddRASS tool is available at \url{https://github.com/amchristi/hddRASS}. It supports the baseline TBSM technique as well as heuristics guidance (H1, H2, CBLS, or AdFL). It also provides support to execute TBSM in greedy mode. As TSAS is a proprietary system, we cannot make its source code, test suite, or tests labels available. The NetBeans IDE (and hence \texttt{openide.awt} module) source code is available online. We also  provide the exact \texttt{openide.awt} module source code, test suite and test labels that we used at \url{https://github.com/amchristi/AdFL}. The same link contains 800 synthetic adaptation scenarios with source code, tests, and test labels for empirical evaluation and comparison.
