\section{Conclusions}
Test-based software minimization offers a conceptually simple, widely applicable, easily understood approach to generating resource adaptations. While TBSM faces significant scalability challenges, and cannot be applied where tests are impossible to label, or to resources not associated with removable features, it also benefits from a powerful synergy: namely, the best way to improve TBSM is to improve software test suites. Making test suites faster to execute, improving their granularity so that tests cover distinct features, increasing code coverage (and other test quality measures), and improving test prioritization techniques all lead not only to more efficient and effective TBSM, but to better fault detection and debugging.
