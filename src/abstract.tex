Building resource adaptive software systems is a challenging problem. Researchers have proposed many techniques and tools to build such systems. We previously proposed a technique called Test-based Software Minimization (TBSM) that relies on using tests to define functionality that can be sacrificed to achieve resource gain. We demonstrate easy-applicability, usability, and effectiveness of TBSM by building resource adaptations for two real-world scenarios. We also discover significant challenges associated with the practical application of TBSM. Based on our attempt to overcome the challenges for two scenarios, we summarize possible solutions to the challenges.
