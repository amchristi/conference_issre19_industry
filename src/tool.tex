\subsection{\mytool under the hood}
\label{sec:experiments}
\mytool combines \HDD with \emph{statement deletion mutation} to provide program
adaptations. We discuss the design and implementation details in the following
section.

\subsubsection{Modifications to \HDD for \RASS}
\label{sec:intutive}


(1)  Reduction may incur many small local changes to software based on the
relaxed specifications. As original HDD setups were designed to quickly converge
to reduced input that is significantly \emph{smaller} than original input, they
tend to make bigger chops earlier in the process. As changes to RASS are going
to be local and smaller, we propose modification to the original algorithm. Our
algorithm always starts with leaf nodes at highest depth level and it chops
smallest possible unit at the beginning (statements for our tool).


(2) Consider any two statement s1 and s2 existing at the same level in AST in
the order s1,s2. Our algorithm always deletes s2 before s1. Our deletions are
always from right to left at the same level in AST. (a) This prevents some
possibilities of non-compilable code and hence costly reverts, use will always
be deleted before def. (b) Later read/write will be deleted before earlier
read/write. Will this have better chance to keep program correct, for Alex to
answer? Reverts will be needed only if any test in test suite failed.


(3) Consider any two statements s1 and s2 existing at a different level in AST
such that s1 is at a higher level. As our algorithm starts from leaf node and
moves upward, s2 will be deleted before s1 ensuring that if def and use are at
different levels, use will be deleted before def, again reducing possibility of
non-compilable code.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}
The basic algorithm, which is a modified version of \HDD is described
in Algorithm~\ref{alg:hdd}.
It is modified to fit into adaptation workflow better by deleting the smallest
nodes first.

\begin{algorithm}

\hrulefill
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{hdd}{$inputTree$}
    \State $level\gets\textsc{HigestDepthLevel}(inputTree)$
    \State $nodes\gets\textsc{TagNodes}(inputTree,level)$ 
    \While{nodes are not empty}
	\State $minConfig\gets\textsc{ddmin}(inputTree)$
	\State $\textsc{prune}(inputTree,level,minConfig)$
	\State $level = level - 1$
	\State $nodes\gets\textsc{TagNodes}(inputTree,level)$ 	
	\EndWhile

    \State \textbf{return} $level$ 
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:hdd}
\end{algorithm}
